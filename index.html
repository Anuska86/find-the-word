            "What's two plus two?" Something about the question irritates me.
            I'm tired. I drift back to sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few minutes pass, then I hear it again. "What's two plus two?" The
            soft, feminine voice lacks emotion and the pronunciation is
            identical to the previous time she said it.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a computer. A computer is hassling me. I'm even more irritated
            now. "Lrmln," I say. I'm surprised. I meant to say "Leave me
            alone"—a completely reasonable response in my opinion—­but I failed
            to speak.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Incorrect," says the computer. "What's two plus two?" Time for an
            experiment. I'll try to say hello. "Hlllch?" I say. "Incorrect.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's two plus two?" What's going on? I want to find out, but I
            don't have much to work with. I can't see. I can't hear anything
            other than the computer. I can't even feel. No, that's not true. I
            feel something. I'm lying down. I'm on something soft. A bed. I
            think my eyes are closed. That's not so bad. All I have to do is
            open them. I try, but nothing happens. Why can't I open my eyes?
            Open. Aaaand . . . open! Open, dang it! Ooh! I felt a wiggle that
            time. My eyelids moved. I felt it. Open! My eyelids creep up and
            blinding light sears my retinas.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Glunn!" I say. I keep my eyes open with sheer force of will.
            Everything is white with shades of pain. "Eye movement detected," my
            tormenter says. "What's two plus two?" The whiteness lessens. My
            eyes are adjusting. I start to see shapes, but nothing sensible yet.
            Let's see . . . can I move my hands? No. Feet? Also no. But I can
            move my mouth, right? I've been saying stuff. Not stuff that makes
            sense, but it's something.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Fffr." "Incorrect. What's two plus two?" The shapes start to make
            sense. I'm in a bed. It's kind of . . . oval-­shaped. LED lights
            shine down on me. Cameras in the ceiling watch my every move. Creepy
            though that is, I'm much more concerned about the robot arms. The
            two brushed-­steel armatures hang from the ceiling. Each has an
            assortment of disturbingly penetration-­looking tools where hands
            should be. Can't say I like the look of that.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ffff . . . oooh . . . rrrr," I say. Will that do? "Incorrect.
            What's two plus two?" Dang it. I summon all my willpower and inner
            strength. Also, I'm starting to panic a little. Good. I use that
            too. "Fffoouurr," I finally say.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Correct." Thank God. I can talk. Sort of. I breathe a sigh of
            relief. Wait—­I just controlled my breathing. I take another breath.
            On purpose. My mouth is sore. My throat is sore. But it's my
            soreness. I have control. I'm wearing a breathing mask. It's tight
            to my face and connected to a hose that goes behind my head. Can I
            get up? No. But I can move my head a little. I look down at my body.
            I'm naked and connected to more tubes than I can count. There's one
            in each arm, one in each leg, one in my "gentlemen's equipment," and
            two that disappear under my thigh. I'm guessing one of them is up
            where the sun doesn't shine. That can't be good. Also, I'm covered
            with electrodes. The sensor-­type stickers like for an EKG, but
            they're all over the place. Well, at least they're only on my skin
            instead of jammed into me.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Wh—­" I wheeze. I try again. "Where . . . am . . . I?" "What's the
            cube root of eight?" the computer asks. "Where am I?" I say again.
            This time it's easier. "Incorrect. What's the cube root of eight?" I
            take a deep breath and speak slowly. "Two times e to the two-­i-­pi
            over three." "Incorrect. What's the cube root of eight?" But I
            wasn't incorrect. I just wanted to see how smart the computer was.
            Answer: not very.
