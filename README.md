📖 Find Your Word:

An interactive word-search and text-exploration tool built with Vanilla JavaScript. This project features an excerpt from the sci-fi novel "Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir.

Users can toggle the text visibility, search for specific words with real-time highlighting, and receive smart feedback based on the search state.

✨ Features:

Toggle Visibility: Smoothly reveal or hide the text with a custom CSS animation.

Intelligent Search: Uses Regular Expressions (RegExp) to find and highlight every instance of a word throughout the text.

UX Validation: \* Prevents searching if the text isn't displayed yet.

Warns the user if the search input is empty.

Alerts the user if the word is not found in the excerpt.

Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing with a "glassmorphism" UI style.

Reset Functionality: Quickly clear highlights and inputs to start over.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

HTML5: Semantic structure for accessibility.

CSS3: Custom animations, Flexbox layout, and backdrop filters for the glassmorphism effect.

JavaScript (ES6+): DOM manipulation, event listeners, and Regular Expressions.

Google Fonts: "Funnel Display" for a modern, clean look.

📝 How to Use:

Click "Display a test text" to reveal the book chapter.

Type a word (e.g., "computer" or "two") into the search bar.
